2) The game list a series of rules/parameters that you have to abide by when selecting a number.

3) My first thought was to bet a fraction of my money and see what happened. I won 10 dollars, but realized that the messages flashed by my screen really quickly. That didn't help so it was on to the next idea.

4) I decided to try and bet an amount greater than my balancec and see if I could win money that way, but I was met with an error message.

5) Finally, after some thinking I decided to attempt a negative value which I was able to enter. I guess numbers that were greater than 10 to ensure I got all my guesses wrong and it subtracted the negative number from my balance; presenting me with the flag.
